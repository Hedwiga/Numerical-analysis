# Numerical-analysis
My laboratory numerical analysis task in university. 
C console:
Lab1: Secant and bisection root-finding methods.
Lab2: Fixed-point iteration and Newton's root-finding methods.
Lab3_4: Gauss's and LU solutions of a system of linear equations. Used mutual recursion.
C++ and Qt:
Lab5: Jacobi's and Seidel's solution of a system of linear equations by iteratively.
Lab6: Least squares method of approximation of the solution of overdetermined systems.
User interface language: Ukrainian
Lab7: Newton's and fixed-point iteration solutions of nonlinear system of equations.
Lab8: Interpolation of discrete set using Lagrange's and Newton's polynomials. 
Lab9: Approximation of discrete set using least squares method.
Lab10: Integration using Riemann (left, right, midpoint), Simpson's and trapezoidal iterative methods.
